# Fibonacci-sequence

🧮 Fibonacci Sequence Generator – C# Console App

A simple C# console application that generates the Fibonacci sequence up to a user-specified index using an iterative method. This project demonstrates array manipulation, user input handling, and formatted console output.

📦 Features

- User Input:
  - Prompts the user to enter the desired Fibonacci index.
  - Parses input and calculates the sequence up to that index.

- Iterative Fibonacci Logic:
  - Uses a loop to compute each Fibonacci number.
  - Stores results in an integer array for easy access and display.

- Console Output:
  - Prints the full Fibonacci sequence up to the entered index.
  - Waits for a key press before closing.
